# Module 4 Homework: Beyonce Fact Quiz

## Description

This project called for using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a functioning quiz, including a timer that counted down at the start of the quiz (and would penalize you for wrong answers by decrementing the time), the first question populating with the start button, then the following questions populating, and finally a score page populating with a place to enter your initials, and get your score. The quiz was also intended to provide dynamic feedback on right or wrong answer throughout.

This project had the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz, WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
  - You will notice on the home screen there is a "Start Quiz" button, once clicked, a timer for 75 seconds begins and the first question populates
WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question
  - Once a button is selected on the first question, you will be presented with the second question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock
  - This part of the code I could not get to work properly, so currently the timer does not decrement the time as intended
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over
  - This part of the code I could not get to work properly, so the "All Done!" screen does not automatically appear once the questions are done, but appears when the timer is out
WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score
  - I did not get this portion of the code to funciton

## Installation

I began with a skeleton outline of the HTML to hold various divs with different purposes. Ther was a div to hold the start button, timer, question, results and dynamic feedback. The divs were given a class or id to be called into the javascript.

The CSS was simple for this project as the functionality was of greater focus. The CSS was used to make the quiz easily readable and organized on the page, and to hide the results section until called.

In the Javascript, first the various ids and classes in the HTML were called using document.querySelector and stored into variables. I began with creating a "blank question" to make the home screen blank until the "Start Quiz" button was clicked. 

There is an event listener on the "Start Quiz" button that begins the timer, where I used setInterval and clearInterval functions to count down by 1 second from 75 seconds.

At the same time, once "Start Quiz" is clicked, a function revealing the first question populates. An array of questions is established in the javascript, called into the function, and moved through a for loop to populate the next question once the first is completed.

After this, another function was created to populate dynamic feedback to the page after each question, however the function is not working properly in the current state of the project.

Missing installation includes: properly displayed feedback that is correct (currently it all presents as "wrong" even if the correct answer is clicked), the "All done!" screen does not appear at the appropriate time, does not give the score, and the form for initials to be entered is not present.

## Usage

With the current project, the functioning pieces include the timer, and the questions populating. As a user, you will start the quiz and populate the questions by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.

Then the next question populates. At this time, the remaining "All done!" screen does not population until the timer is out.
